	abstract = {Characterization of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) B-mode 
polarization signal will test models of inflationary cosmology, as well
as constrain the sum of the neutrino masses and other cosmological
parameters. The low intensity of the B-mode signal combined with the
need to remove polarized galactic foregrounds requires a sensitive
millimeter receiver and effective methods of foreground removal. Current
bolometric detector technology is reaching the sensitivity limit set by
the CMB photon noise. Thus, we need to increase the optical throughput
to increase an experiment's sensitivity. To increase the throughput
without increasing the focal plane size, we can increase the frequency
coverage of each pixel. Increased frequency coverage per pixel has
additional advantage that we can split the signal into frequency bands
to obtain spectral information. The detection of multiple frequency
bands allows for removal of the polarized foreground emission from
synchrotron radiation and thermal dust emission, by utilizing its
spectral dependence. Traditionally, spectral information has been
captured with a multi-chroic focal plane consisting of a heterogeneous
mix of single-color pixels. To maximize the efficiency of the focal
plane area, we developed a multi-chroic pixel. This increases the number
of pixels per frequency with same focal plane area. We developed
multi-chroic antenna-coupled transition edge sensor (TES) detector array
for the CMB polarimetry. In each pixel, a silicon lens-coupled dual
polarized sinuous antenna collects light over a two-octave frequency
band. The antenna couples the broadband millimeter wave signal into
microstrip transmission lines, and on-chip filter banks split the
broadband signal into several frequency bands. Separate TES bolometers
detect the power in each frequency band and linear polarization. We will
describe the design and performance of these devices and present optical
data taken with prototype pixels and detector arrays. Our measurements
show beams with percent level ellipticity, percent level
cross-polarization leakage, and partitioned bands using banks of two and
three filters. We will also describe the development of broadband
anti-reflection coatings for the high dielectric constant lens. The
broadband anti-reflection coating has approximately 100\% bandwidth and
no detectable loss at cryogenic temperature. We will describe a next
generation CMB polarimetry experiment, the POLARBEAR-2, in detail. The
POLARBEAR-2 would have focal planes with kilo-pixel of these detectors
to achieve high sensitivity. We'll also introduce proposed experiments
that would use multi-chroic detector array we developed in this work.
We'll conclude by listing out suggestions for future multichroic
detector development.},

	abstract = {A continuously rotating half-wave plate (CRHWP) is a promising tool to improve the sensitivity to large angular scales in cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization measurements. With a CRHWP, single detectors can measure all three of the Stokes parameters, \$I\$, \$Q\$ and \$U\$, thereby avoiding the set of systematic errors that can be introduced by mismatches in the properties of orthogonal detector pairs. We focus on the implementation of CRHWPs in large aperture telescopes (i.e. the primary mirror is larger than the current maximum half-wave plate diameter of \${\textbackslash}sim\$0.5 m), where the CRHWP can be placed between the primary mirror and focal plane. In this configuration, one needs to address the intensity to polarization (\$I\{{\textbackslash}rightarrow\}P\$) leakage of the optics, which becomes a source of 1/f noise and also causes differential gain systematics that arise from CMB temperature fluctuations. In this paper, we present the performance of a CRHWP installed in the POLARBEAR experiment, which employs a Gregorian telescope with a 2.5 m primary illumination pattern. The CRHWP is placed near the prime focus between the primary and secondary mirrors. We find that the \$I\{{\textbackslash}rightarrow\}P\$ leakage is larger than the expectation from the physical properties of our primary mirror, resulting in a 1/f knee of 100 mHz. The excess leakage could be due to imperfections in the detector system, i.e. detector non-linearity in the responsivity and time-constant. We demonstrate, however, that by subtracting the leakage correlated with the intensity signal, the 1/f noise knee frequency is reduced to 32 mHz (\${\textbackslash}ell {\textbackslash}sim\$39 for our scan strategy), which is sufficient to probe the primordial B-mode signal. We also discuss methods for further noise subtraction in future projects where the precise temperature control of instrumental components and the leakage reduction will play a key role.},
